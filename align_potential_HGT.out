SCRIPT 8

align_potential_HGT.sh aligns the sequence of every blast hits of selected 
Gene_family_*_parsed.out (listed in list_files_HGT_to_trees.txt) in its created folder of group of bees 
(data/alignment_potential_HGT/Bumble_bees_proteins/, 
data/alignment_potential_HGT/Honey_bees_proteins/, 
data/alignment_potential_HGT/Bumble_Honey_bees_proteins/).

Inputs: amino_acid_seq_Gene_family_*_parsed.fasta in data/alignment_potential_HGT/protein_seq/

Outputs: Gene_family_*_parsed.multifasta in its corresponding folder of group of bees 
(data/alignment_potential_HGT/Bumble_bees_proteins/, 
data/alignment_potential_HGT/Honey_bees_proteins/, 
data/alignment_potential_HGT/Bumble_Honey_bees_proteins/) - each output file contains 
aligned protein sequences of every blast hits of a selected gene family
