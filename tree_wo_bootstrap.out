SCRIPT 9

tree_wo_bootstrap.sh runs RAXML tool to infer phylogenetic trees (without bootstrapping) 
of all aligned protein sequences of every blast hits of selected Gene_family_*_parsed.out  
(in its bee folder in data/alignment_potential_HGT/). 

Inputs: Gene_family_*_parsed.multifasta in its corresponding folder of group of bees 
(data/alignment_potential_HGT/Bumble_bees_proteins/, 
data/alignment_potential_HGT/Honey_bees_proteins/, 
data/alignment_potential_HGT/Bumble_Honey_bees_proteins/) listed in 
list_files_HGT_to_trees.txt (data/parsed_blast)

Outputs: ML_wo_bootstrap_Gene_family_*_parsed.out in data/alignment_potential_HGT/RAxML_results/

>> RAxML_bestTree.ML_wo_bootstrap_Gene_family_*_parsed can then be opened using 
FigTree tool (available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/)
